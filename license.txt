Basically, you can do whatever you want with this source code, I don't
care. See below for the full details.

However, Detours has it's own license. You need to comply with that also.
In particular, there are restrictions on what you can do with an .EXE
you've made. You can't sell it, for instance. Nor can you link with
anything that uses the GPL/LGPL.
